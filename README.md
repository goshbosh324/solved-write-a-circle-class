Write a Circle class  that has the following member variables :• radius: a double• pi: a double  initialized  with the value  3.14159

The class  should have the following member functions:

• Default Constructor . A default constructor  that sets radius to 0.0.• Constructor . Accepts the radius of the circle as an argument .• setRadius. A mutator function for the radius variable .• getRadius. An accessor function for the radius variable .• getArea. Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as area = pi * radius * radius• getDiameter. Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as diameter = radius * 2• getCircumference. Returns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as circumference = 2 * pi * radius

Write a program  that demonstrates the Circle class  by asking the user for the circle’s radius, creating a Circle object , and then reporting the circle’s area, diameter, and circumference.

<strong>Sample Run:</strong>

<em>Calling defeault constructor: The circle’s radius in the default Circle Object is: 0</em>

<em>Calling setRadius(20) to change radius of default:</em>

<em>The circle’s radius in the default Circle Object is Now: 20</em>

<em>Creating Circle circle2(10):</em>

<em>The circle2’s radius in the circle2 Object is: 10</em>

<em>The circle2’s area is therefore: 314.159</em>

<em>The circle2’s diameter is therefore: 20</em>

<em>The circle2’s circumference is therefore: 62.8318</em>
